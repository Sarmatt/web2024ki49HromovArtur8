## Project Overview
The project is a business card site of the game called RustCraft, which is being developed by my team.

### HTML and CSS
The frontend presentation relies on the foundational elements of HTML and CSS. Our web pages are meticulously crafted with a focus on simplicity and elegance to ensure an immersive user experience.

### PHP (The MVP of the Backend)
PHP is at the heart of our backend infrastructure, providing stability and reliability to our application despite its longstanding presence.

### MySQL
MySQL handles data management, recognized for its reliability and commitment to maintaining relational integrity and ACID compliance. While newer database solutions may offer scalability, the stability and familiarity of MySQL are key strengths for our project.
